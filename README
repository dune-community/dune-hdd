dune-hdd is a DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org) module which provides high
dimensional discretizations for grid-based discretizations of pdes. It makes
use of the discretization modules dune-gdt
(http://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-gdt/) and dune-pdelab
(http://www.dune-project.org/pdelab/index.html). For each pde, this module
provides analytical problems (that describe the pde) together with
appropriate discretizations for the pde. dune-hhd is also intended to be used
with pyMor (http://pymor.org) in the context of model reduction, hence its
name.

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
dune-hdd-demos (http://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-hdd-demos).
Experienced DUNE users may go ahead. As usual, you will have to call autogen,
configure and make using dunecontrol
(see http://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation-notes.html), working
examples are located in 'examples/'...
